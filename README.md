## Deploy to Firebase using GitHub actions

In order to setup the project to use the Firebase, first head to https://console.firebase.google.com and register your project. Enable at least the hosting, also the Firestore and the Storage, if needed.

Follow the instructions to set up, or simply fill in the Firebase related configuration files in the root directory of this repository. Also need to add `./src/.env` file with the following env-variables:
```text
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY="key"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN="domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE="domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID="domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_LOCATION_ID="domain"
```
Fill in with the configuration values, this file is ignored by the git, so it won't be published in the repositry.

Make sure to configure `.github/deploy.yml` properly by adding all necessary environment variables. 

No not expose the FIREBASE_KEY! Instead, it can be added to the GitHub secrets in the project settings section. The key itself should also be part of the Firebase project configuration. 

Finally, in order to setup GitHub actions deployments to Firebase hosting, a FIREBASE_TOKEN secret has to be added to the GitHub secrets as well. In order to get the token, run `firebase login:ci`, log into the project and copy the token from the console afterwards.
